        <p>Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.</p>
        <p>It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a "yellow veil" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different.</p>
